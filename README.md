ðŸ“ž Phone Book Application â€“ Python Project

This repository contains a command-line Phone Book application developed in Python, as part of the course **Algorithms Programming in Python**, within the **Faculty of Automation, Computers and Electronics**, *University of Craiova*.  https://ace.ucv.ro/

ðŸ“š Project Overview

The Phone Book application is a console-based tool that allows users to manage contact information in a structured and persistent manner. It was developed to demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving skills, modular programming, and practical use of Python data structures.

The program enables users to perform core operations such as:

- Adding a new contact
- Searching for existing contacts
- Editing contact information
- Deleting contacts
- Viewing the entire list of saved contacts
- Saving and loading data from a file
- Send details of a contact on WhatsApp/Gmail/Telegram
- Upload/take photo for each contact

Each contact entry includes the following fields:

- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Phone Number** (required)
- **Email Address** (optional)

The user interacts with the application via a textual menu interface, which guides them through available actions using numeric choices. The contact data is stored in memory and optionally persisted to a file to ensure data retention across sessions.

This project also aims to familiarize students with:

- Input/output operations
- String manipulation and validation
- File handling using the `json` module
- Structuring code into reusable modules and functions
